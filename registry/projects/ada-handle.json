  "description": "ADA Handle is an innovative feature built on the Cardano blockchain that leverages the power of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to create custom, human-readable wallet addresses. Launched as a way to enhance user experience and accessibility within the Cardano ecosystem, ADA Handle allows users to replace the typically long and complex cryptographic wallet addresses (e.g., a string of 50+ random characters) with short, memorable, and personalized identifiers, such as \"$johndoe\" or \"$cryptoqueen.\" These custom handles are minted as NFTs, making them unique, verifiable, and fully owned by the user on the blockchain. 258k+ Handles have been minted and over 65k holders.",
